Engineering is drowning in tools, alerts, and context switches.

**Core realities**

- Fragmented tooling: 7–12 tools per engineer per day
- Context switching kills deep work
- Documentation and updates consume more energy than coding
- Tribal knowledge keeps evaporating
- Leaders lack real visibility into flow, risk, and delivery pressure

**Outcome**

Slower releases, inconsistent quality, and rising burnout.

Engineering needs a unified intelligence layer — not another dashboard.
